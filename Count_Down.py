Count down from a given number to another viaa certian interval.

num = 800

while num > 200:
    num -= 100
#    print(num) #Just checks that everything is going according to plan.
    

### Starting number can be altered as needed.
### Deincrements can be adjusted.
### Ending number is easy to change, and based on deincrements/specificity of the question it may be better to include a >= instead of > sign.
